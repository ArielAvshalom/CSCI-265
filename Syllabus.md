**Prereqs:**

CSCI 16000; MATH 15000
I strongly recommend reading chapter zero of our textbook before the semester begins.

**Textbook:**

Introduction to the Theory of Computation 3rd Edition by Michael Sipser

**About the Course:**

At this point, you’ve all taken some courses in computer science, often times challenging and fun courses like Intro to C++ or Discrete Math. This course is flavored with elements of discrete math and often ranges from interesting to tedious. 
You’ll learn about the ideas that brought about the computers in use today. From the simplest Finite Automata to Turing Machines, there’s a lot to learn. We may also cover the basic principles behind algorithm analysis (when I say basic, I mean that you’ll most likely never use the definitions from this course in a real algorithms course).
This course takes a deep dive into proofs, so I highly recommend you brace yourself. They may not seem important in the implementation of code, but they’re the reason why everything works the way it does. Once you have a better picture of how a computer works behind the scenes, so much more of what you study in the future will make sense.
It’s my hope that we can have fun this semester, studying computer science theory and also taking a deep dive in other more interesting topics when time permits. 

See you all soon!
