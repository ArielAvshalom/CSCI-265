## Prereqs:

CSCI 16000; MATH 15000
I strongly recommend reading chapter zero of our textbook before the semester begins.

## Textbook:

Introduction to the Theory of Computation 3rd Edition by Michael Sipser

<div>
At this point, you’ve all taken some courses in computer science, often times challenging and fun courses like Intro to C++ or Discrete Math. This course is flavored with elements of discrete math and often ranges from interesting to tedious.
<br></br>
You’ll learn about the ideas that brought about the computers in use today. From the simplest Finite Automata to Turing Machines, there’s a lot to learn. We may also cover the basic principles behind algorithm analysis (when I say basic, I mean that you’ll most likely never use the definitions from this course in a real algorithms course).
<br></br>
This course takes a deep dive into proofs, so I highly recommend you brace yourself. They may not seem important in the implementation of code, but they’re the reason why everything works the way it does. Once you have a better picture of how a computer works behind the scenes, so much more of what you study in the future will make sense.
<br></br>
It’s my hope that we can have fun this semester, studying computer science theory and also taking a deep dive in other more interesting topics when time permits. 
<br></br>
See you all soon!
